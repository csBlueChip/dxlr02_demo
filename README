WHAT
====
This is a demo of the DXLR02 LoRa modules.
It's quick and dirty, and a little fragile:
  eg. You MUST put the Port config above the Lora Config in the config file.

FEATURE(S)
==========
The dx-lr02 modules ONLY function as a "virutal serial cable"
No LoraWAN, No Mesahtastic, No <other stuff>.

MORE README
===========
Read the DEMO config file for summary notes on the options.

TL;DR
=====
To test your modules:
	1. Connect them to your Linux box
	2. Run:  ./test.sh dxlr02_A.conf dxlr02_B.conf

NOT VISIBLE
===========
If the devices are "not visible"
	1. disconnect the devices
	2. run: `sudo dmesg -w`
	3. reconnect the devices
	4. read the device names as they scroll up the screen
	   eg. usb 2-2.1: ch341-uart converter now attached to ttyUSB0
	   The important bit is the "ttyUSB0" on the end

If they are not ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB1,
you will need to edit the names at the top of the _A and _B config files
	DEV='/dev/ttyUSB0'

RTFM
====
Take a moment to read all the info the first time it spews up the screen.
There was a lot of information to covey - I've tried to be succinct.

TEST.SH
=======
The test script simply runs `dxlr02.sh` for each device
...and then opens up a couple of copies of `picocom`* in a `tmux`* shell

DXLR02.SH
=========
The `dxlr02.sh` script reads
	a) serial port config
	   passed to `stty`
	   allows the PC to talk to the dxlr02
	b) lora config
	   echoed to the serial device port
	   allows the dxlr02's to talk to each other

AT COMMANDS
===========
Each "AT command" MUST be suffixed with \r\n (aka CR/LF, or 0x0d 0x0a)
...and MUST be transmitted as a single block of data.
If you try to type it, or paste it, it throws ERROR's.

PATIENCE
========
They are super flaky (try running `sudo dmesg -w` in another window!)
	failed to send control message: -110  <-- this is a USB transmission error
...So you may need to try a few times
But once they are running, they seem pretty stable

SPEED UP
========
It appears ALL settings are saved to NVRAM the moment they are set,
so you only need to run the module config process after editing a config file
  `./test` always needs two config files
     but you can add "-skip" to skip the Lora config phase
       eg. `./test.sh dxlr02_A.conf dxlr02_B.conf -skip`

HARDWARE
========
There are 2 exposed IO ports, M0 and M1
There is no documented way to utilise them !?
There is also an undocumented AUX pin <shrug>

You just need 4 wires ... {Tx-->Rx, Rx<--Tx, Vcc---5V, Gnd---Gnd}

       +------------------------+ +---------------+

* `picocom` was just FAR more stable than `minicom`
* `tmux` is (imho) easier to script than `screen`
